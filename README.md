 Roll dice game
 The idea of this game is that we roll a dice.
 Every time you roll the dice the number gets added to your current and total score.
 You can roll the dice again and the score is added to the total score or you can hold the score and switch to player 2.
 Whenever you roll a one, you lose all your current score, and then it's the next player turn (that's why sometimes you need to hold your points).
 The first player that reaches 100 points wins the game.
